# Summary

This dashboard visualises data found free online the National Records of Scotland website. It is described as the age-standardised death rates calculated using the European standard population. The link to the publication, and all data, can be found at https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/age-standardised-death-rates-calculated-using-the-esp. 

The purpose of this dashboard is to demonstrate my skills in Tableau, as developed during my tenure at Public Health Scotland's Discovery Team. Hence, the aesthetics look similar to what one might find when browsing the Discovery platform.
