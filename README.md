# Death_Rates_Scotland
A tableau dashboard that visualises data found free online the National Records of Scotland website. It is described as the age-standardised death rates calculated using the European standard population. The purpose of this dashboard is to demonstrate my skills in Tableau, and mimic a dashboard that I made at my tenure in Public Health Scotland.
